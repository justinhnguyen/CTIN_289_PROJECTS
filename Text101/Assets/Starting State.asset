  storyText: 'You are standing in the middle of a dark forest. The trees are tall
    and the branches are thick, blocking out most of the moonlight. You can hear
    the sound of animals rustling in the bushes, and you feel a chill run down your
    spine.



    You have two options:



    1. You can go left and follow the
    sound of the river.

    2. You can go right and climb the hill.



    What
    do you do?'
