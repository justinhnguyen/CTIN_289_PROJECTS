  storyText: "The two of ye unsheathe yer cutlasses and plunge into a fierce skirmish.
    His fearsome renown goes ahead like a ghostly warning, and he proves the better
    blade in this fight. Without a moment's delay, he claims yer life and, in turn,
    inherits the accursed captain's fate, becoming the new bearer of the Flying Dutchman's
    curse.\r \n\r\nPerhaps there be another way to be free of the Captain's without
    losing yer life. Try again?\r\n\r\n1. Yes\r\n\r\n2. No"
