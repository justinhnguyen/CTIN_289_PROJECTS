  storyText: '"Come in," ye say, and Finn takes a seat by yer side. As a loyal mate,
    he cares deeply for yer well-being and offers his counsel. Ye confide, "Truth
    be told, lad, I''ve grown weary of bein'' the captain of the Flying Dutchman.
    I long to be a regular man once more."

    

    Finn, with genuine care,
    offers to take yer place. Do ye accept his offer?

    

    1: Aye, I accept.


    2:
    Nay, I must bear this curse alone.'
